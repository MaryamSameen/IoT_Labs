### Task 1:

We connected ESP32 to ThingsSpeak through things speak API(write) and sent Sensor data collected by ESP32 to Cloud ThingsSpeak dashboard and visuallize the data updation patterns.

CheckInterval =20 is because we are using cloud for Free that doesn't allow us to send data for less than 15 sec.
