s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind((sta.ifconfig()[0], 80))
s.listen(5)

Explanation of the Code:
This code is setting up a TCP server using the socket module in Python. It is typically used in network programming for communication between devices. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each line does:

1. ### socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
socket.socket() â†’ Creates a new socket object.
socket.AF_INET â†’ Specifies the IPv4 address family (used for internet communication).
socket.SOCK_STREAM â†’ Specifies a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) socket, which is connection-oriented and reliable.
ðŸ”¹ Why is it used?
To establish a TCP/IP connection where devices can exchange data reliably.

2. ### s.bind((sta.ifconfig()[0], 80))
.bind() â†’ Binds the socket to a specific IP address and port number.
sta.ifconfig()[0] â†’ Retrieves the IP address of the ESP32 (assuming sta is a Wi-Fi interface object).
80 â†’ This is the port number used for HTTP communication (commonly used for web servers).
ðŸ”¹ Why is it used?
It allows the device to listen for incoming connections on port 80, meaning other devices can send HTTP requests to this ESP32.

3. ### s.listen(5)
.listen(5) â†’ Puts the server in listening mode, so it waits for clients to connect.
5 â†’ Specifies the maximum number of queued connections (backlog). If more than 5 clients try to connect at the same time, additional connections will be refused.
ðŸ”¹Why is it used?
This makes the ESP32 ready to accept incoming requests and process multiple connections efficiently.

### How These Functions Work Together:
Creates a TCP socket to communicate over the internet.
Binds the socket to the deviceâ€™s IP and port 80 (for HTTP requests).
Listens for incoming connections and waits for clients to connect.
After this setup, you would typically accept connections using:
conn, addr = s.accept()  # Accepts a new client connection
print("Client connected from:", addr)
